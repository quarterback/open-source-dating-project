# Open Source Dating Profile Project

![Dating](date1.png)

N.B. The [Date Me Doc](https://dateme.directory/) project seems to capture the same essence as this and has wider adoption. I'd suggest checking it out. 

The Open Source Dating Project (OSDP) functions as a speculative critical design piece that analyzes and comments on the nature of modern online dating environments. In an era where digital dating interactions are often profit-driven and impersonal, this conceptual art project evokes the simplistic, human essence of the early internet's vision for authentic connection. By imagining a template reminiscent of the classic personal website guestbook adapted for individual dating profiles, the OSDP prompts reflection on the stark contrast between the type of user-driven self-expression this suggests, and the cold, impersonal interfaces of contemporary commercial dating apps that employ algorithms. 

Rather than aiming to initiate a real-world movement or revolutionize online dating, the OSDP serves as a thought-provoking conceptual critique, a conversation starter about the current state of digital romantic relationships. By presenting a hypothetical alternative approach, this speculative design piece highlights how modern dating apps prioritize commercial interests over meaningful human connection. 

As a work of critical design, the OSDP reminds us of the internet's potential as a tool for authentic human interaction, while commenting on how today's online dating has drifted from that original vision in pursuit of profit motives. It represents an invitation to reminisce, discuss, and imagine - what could a digital dating landscape look like if it honored individuality over algorithms? The OSDP asks us to reflect on this question through its speculative critical lens.

## Concept

Online dating, once a quaint idea facilitated by the early internet, has, like many modern-day conveniences, been morphed into a less personal, commercialized endeavor. The charm of 'putting oneself out there' and the prospect of organic interactions with individuals from various walks of life has been overshadowed by the mechanical swipes on today's dating apps. The Open Source Dating Project (OSDP) seeks to rekindle that old-school spirit by drawing inspiration from the simplicity and personal touch of original website guestbooks, repurposing this concept for modern-day dating.

In the early days of the internet, message boards, guestbooks, and small community websites were the portals through which many forged new friendships, found a sense of community, and often, explored romantic possibilities. These platforms were more than just spaces to drop messages; they were spaces where one could share a part of themselves, and find others with shared interests, all within a framework that encouraged genuine interaction.

Fast forward to the present, and we find ourselves navigating through a dystopian landscape of dating apps, where the essence of individuality is often lost amidst the rush to match with the 'perfect' profile. The OSDP aims to break free from this mold, offering instead a Carte de visite for the digital age. This project is not about creating yet another dating platform, but about providing a template, a starting point for individuals to create their own dating profile page,

## How to Use
Clone this repo. Take the template and put it on your website. Mine is static, so it'd just be a page on my site, but yours might require more customization. 

### Customization
Add and remove sections to the template as you wish, it's meant to reflect your personality and wishes. 

## Privacy and Safety

In the spirit of self-hosted, personal web pages, this project encourages individual expression while also emphasizing the importance of privacy and safety. Here are some tips and best practices to keep in mind:

### Personal Information:
- **Minimal Sharing**: Share only the minimal amount of personal information needed to convey your interests and what you are looking for. Avoid sharing sensitive information such as your home address, phone number, or financial details.
- **Contact Information**: Consider creating a separate email address for dating communications. Avoid sharing your primary email address, phone number, or other direct contact information publicly. Instead, use private messaging systems where possible.

### Hosting:
- **HTTPS**: Ensure that your personal website uses HTTPS to encrypt data in transit, protecting your privacy and that of your visitors.
- **Domain Privacy**: If registering a domain for hosting your profile, consider using domain privacy services to protect your personal information associated with the domain registration.

### Interaction:
- **First Meetings**: When meeting someone for the first time, choose a public place, and let a trusted person know where you'll be and when.
- **Trust Your Instincts**: Trust your instincts and exercise caution when interacting with others. If something feels off, it's okay to disengage.

### Reporting Concerns:
- **Community Vigilance**: Encourage a culture of community vigilance and support. If you notice suspicious behavior or receive concerning messages, consider reporting them to relevant local authorities.

### Education:
- **Stay Informed**: Stay informed about best practices for online safety. Familiarize yourself with common online scams and how to avoid them.

### Resources:
- [StaySafeOnline](https://staysafeonline.org/): Provides resources on understanding online safety.
- [Get Safe Online](https://www.getsafeonline.org/): Offers advice on protecting yourself, your computers and devices, and your business against the likes of fraud, identity theft, viruses, and many other problems encountered online.

Remember, the core of this project is to foster genuine connections while maintaining a high degree of personal safety and data privacy.
