# Open Source Dating Profile Project

This project hearkens back to the early ethos of the web, providing a template for a self-hosted dating profile page. It's a conceptual design project aimed at evoking the spirit of a web that championed personal ownership and self-expression.

## Concept
Online dating (nee internet dating) is a once-quaint concept that like most modern things, have been ruined by jerks. While it's always been precarious to "put yourself out there," online dating gave regular people the chance to meet people in their city they might not otherwise meet. Thousands of people can cite meeting friends on message boards, random websites that have been long shuttered, and many hours spent interacting with people who'd simply never been possible to find through normal places and spaces. The OSDP takes the form of the old guestbook from original websites and flips it through the form of dating sites.

Modern dating apps are a dystopian form of finding people and OSDP is a Carte de visite for a modern world.

## How to Use
Clone this repo. Take the template and put it on your website. Mine is static, so it'd just be a page on my site, but yours might require more customization. 

### Customization
Add and remove sections to the template as you wish, it's meant to reflect your personality and wishes. 

## Template

## Privacy and Safety## Privacy and Safety

In the spirit of self-hosted, personal web pages, this project encourages individual expression while also emphasizing the importance of privacy and safety. Here are some tips and best practices to keep in mind:

### Personal Information:
- **Minimal Sharing**: Share only the minimal amount of personal information needed to convey your interests and what you are looking for. Avoid sharing sensitive information such as your home address, phone number, or financial details.
- **Contact Information**: Consider creating a separate email address for dating communications. Avoid sharing your primary email address, phone number, or other direct contact information publicly. Instead, use private messaging systems where possible.

### Hosting:
- **HTTPS**: Ensure that your personal website uses HTTPS to encrypt data in transit, protecting your privacy and that of your visitors.
- **Domain Privacy**: If registering a domain for hosting your profile, consider using domain privacy services to protect your personal information associated with the domain registration.

### Interaction:
- **First Meetings**: When meeting someone for the first time, choose a public place, and let a trusted person know where you'll be and when.
- **Trust Your Instincts**: Trust your instincts and exercise caution when interacting with others. If something feels off, it's okay to disengage.

### Reporting Concerns:
- **Community Vigilance**: Encourage a culture of community vigilance and support. If you notice suspicious behavior or receive concerning messages, consider reporting them to relevant local authorities.

### Education:
- **Stay Informed**: Stay informed about best practices for online safety. Familiarize yourself with common online scams and how to avoid them.

### Resources:
- [StaySafeOnline](https://staysafeonline.org/): Provides resources on understanding online safety.
- [Get Safe Online](https://www.getsafeonline.org/): Offers advice on protecting yourself, your computers and devices, and your business against the likes of fraud, identity theft, viruses, and many other problems encountered online.

Remember, the core of this project is to foster genuine connections while maintaining a high degree of personal safety and data privacy.
